    FINAL FORENSIC VERDICT
    ======================
    Weighted Score: 2.0/5
    
    COURTROOM SUMMARY:
    ⚖️ Defense: The developer's work, although incomplete, demonstrates a clear intention towards a structured and modular approach. The use of fan-in and fan-out metrics, even if not fully integrated, indicates an awareness of system dependencies and the aim to create a scalable architecture. This intent is crucial in laying down the groundwork for future enhancements, allowing for easier identification and refactoring of bottlenecks or overused modules.
⚖️ Prosecutor: The evidence provided clearly indicates a case of Orchestration Fraud. The claim of a multi-agent system is unsupported by the code, as no code or rationale is provided to substantiate this claim. The absence of any code or documentation that demonstrates a multi-agent system suggests a linear approach, contrary to the claims made.
⚖️ TechLead: The project appears to lack clarity in its use of modern tools and maintainability practices. The evidence provided does not confirm the use of modern tools like uv, langgraph, or pydantic, which are essential for ensuring the project is up-to-date with current technological standards. Additionally, the absence of validated requirements and the presence of unknown requirements suggest a lack of structured documentation and organization, which are critical for maintainability.
    
    FINAL DETERMINATION: REJECTED

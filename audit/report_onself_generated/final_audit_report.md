# 🛡️ SwarmAuditor v2.0 Forensic Record
**Generated:** 2026-02-27 11:31:45

## 🏛️ COURTROOM VERDICT: ACCEPTED
**Final Weighted Score:** 3.80 / 5.0

### 👨‍⚖️ Judicial Opinions (Protocol B)
| Judge | Score | Argument |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| DEFENSE | 4.0/5 | [MITIGATION]: The architectural design demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of parallel processing and orchestration, as evidenced by the accurate LangGraph State Machine diagram and verified parallel flow. The presence of a Fan-In node confirms the correct orchestration from parallel judges, showcasing a nuanced approach to system design. [REQUEST]: Given the successful implementation of distinct agent personas and the strategic choice to prioritize rapid prototyping, a score adjustment to 4 is warranted to reflect the project's innovative and pragmatic approach. |
| PROSECUTOR | 3.0/5 | The evidence indicates a breach of Protocol B-1 due to missing core files and theoretical frameworks essential for orchestration and hallucination processes. |
| TECHLEAD | 4.5/5 | The engineering analysis of the system under Protocol B-2 reveals a robust adherence to engineering standards, particularly in the orchestration and parallel flow validation phases. However, the presence of hallucinated paths in the repository indicates potential discrepancies in the codebase documentation, which could lead to maintainability challenges. The absence of key architectural terms such as 'Dialectical Synthesis' and 'State Synchronization' suggests a need for enhanced architectural clarity and documentation. |

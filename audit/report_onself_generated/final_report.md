**Item Score:** `4.9/5` | **Status:** ✅

| Judge | Dialectical Argument & Actionable Advice |
| :--- | :--- |
| Defense | [state] The defense highlights the use of AST-based state tracking as proof of sovereign intent. This exceeds basic dict-based state management. |
| Prosecutor | [state] Pydantic models and Annotated reducers verified via AST scan. |
| TechLead | [arch] VERDICT: Schema Integrity is sound. |

**Item Score:** `3.0/5` | **Status:** ⚠️

| Judge | Dialectical Argument & Actionable Advice |
| :--- | :--- |
| Defense | [graph] Multi-agent collaboration confirmed via LangGraph node separation. The architecture shows a clear commitment to non-linear swarm logic. |
| Prosecutor | [graph] CHARGE: Orchestration Fraud. System lacks parallel nodes; architecture is a linear simulation. |
